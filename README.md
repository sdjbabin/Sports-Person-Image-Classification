Model Training
We chose a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification model for this project due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 82% on our dataset.

While deep learning techniques can yield even higher accuracy, this project emphasizes how simple machine learning can also be used effectively for image classification, making it accessible for those who prefer a less complex solution.

Usage
Collect sports personality images or use the provided dataset.
Preprocess the data to prepare it for model training.
Train the machine learning models using the provided scripts.
Evaluate model performance using metrics and guidelines.
Test unknown images using the provided Python Tkinter GUI for image recognition.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various sports personalities. You can find more details about the dataset in the dataset/README.md file.

Evaluation
